Description: This package is a U-statistics based implementation of the 
               Probabilistic Index Models (PIM) proposed by Thas et al. (2012). 
               It supports weighted PIM estimation, which is not implemented 
               in the original authors' {pim} package. It's also more efficient 
               and light-weight.
